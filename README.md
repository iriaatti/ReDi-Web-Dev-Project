# MEMORY GAME

## DESCRIPTION
This project is a memory card game made with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript where the main goal is to find the pairs of pictures by clicking 2 cards at a time, featuring 12 cards and a score counter. 

With JavaScript, the click interaction triggers the program to look at the pictures and identify matches, reacting adequately to the results. If it is a pair, the matching cards will be highlited green and a point will be added to the score. Otherwise, the cards will face down again. Until all the pairs are revelead.
The game can be restarted at any moment with a button "Start", which will always generate a new set of cards with random positions and reset the score to zero.

The purpose of this project was learning/practice and the choice of creating a simple game comes from my personal interest in games.
